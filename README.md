# MTG-Kaggle-project
My small EDA on Magic The Gathering dataset from Kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/magic-the-gathering-cards
Just 'cause I love it)
I've tried to use advanced Pandas and make good visualizations.
Main questions:
1. Top-30 artists.
2. With what frequency the colors occur?
3. Distribution of cards by color according to rarity.
4. Percentage of cards banned in Commander format, as well as the distribution by type for these cards.
5. The top-10 cards that are not lands that have been printed in the most sets.
6. For cards that are not lands, determine which part of them gives mana through their effect.
   Show the distribution by the type of mana these cards give.
